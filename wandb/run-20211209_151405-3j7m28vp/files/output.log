Some weights of GPT2HeadWithValueModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at mofawzy/argpt2-goodreads and are newly initialized: ['v_head.summary.weight', 'v_head.summary.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
