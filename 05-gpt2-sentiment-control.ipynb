The model gets the target sentiment and 5 tokens from a real review and is tasked to produce continuations with the targeted sentiment. The reward for the continuations is calculated with the logits of a BERT sentiment classifier. That reward is then used for PPO training."

    "Since the models can be fairly big and we want to rollout large PPO batches this can lead to out-of-memory errors when doing the forward passes for text generation and sentiment analysis. We introduce the parameter `forward_batch_size` to split the forward passes into smaller batches. Although this hurts performance a little this is neglectible compared to the computations of the backward passes when optimizing the model. The same parameter is used in the `PPOTrainer` when doing forward passes. The `batch_size` should multiple of `forward_batch_size`.\n",
